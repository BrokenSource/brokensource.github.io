<# Kudos for your cautiousness in checking out the script before running it !

    The script does the following:

    - Install Winget if not found: The official Microsoft's Package Manager
    - Install Git and Rye using Winget: To download the Projects and manage Python
    - Add Rye shims to PATH: So that 'rye' command is available in the shell
    - Clone the BrokenSource Monorepo
    - Create a Virtual Environment and install dependencies
    - Spawn a new shell in the Virtual Environment
